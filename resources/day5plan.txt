rules 

updates

---------------

only need to figure out which ones are correct

parse file, 
store reports in an array
for each index, bool function 'correct', check if rule applies (both numbers need to be in 
the array), then check each rule, 
if a rule is not true, change the 'correct' bool and yeet it from the array


store them in an array so we can get the middle page number

seem to all be odd nr so count + 1 /2 would be a rounded up int
